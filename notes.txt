What I want to do.

Home base that knows the layout and is able to find the position of all the robots

A function which allows the robots to ask where they are

Task assignment and planning for the robots from a central hub
-- Maybe in the future make each robot think for itself, but I like the idea of having one place do everything.

Functions which allow the robots move in a direction
